Persistent variables reused every frame
{
  Vector2D position;
  Vector2D velocity;
  Vector2D acceleration;
  float shipHeadingRadians;
  const float shipThrust = whatever.0f;
}

Each frame, only if the player is applying thrust
{
  acceleration.x += shipThrust * cos(shipHeadingRadians);
  acceleration.y += shipThrust * sin(shipHeadingRadians);
}

Each frame, regardless of whether player presses anything
{
  position += velocity * timestep;
  velocity += acceleration * timestep;
  acceleration.x = 0;
  acceleration.y = 0;
}
